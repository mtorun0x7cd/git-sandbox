# Git Sandbox

This repository serves as a personal sandbox for testing and validating various Git configurations and development workflows.

## Purpose

*   **S/MIME Commit Signing:** The initial commit was made to verify that S/MIME signing is correctly configured locally.
*   **Git Configuration:** A safe place to test new Git aliases, hooks, or other settings.
*   **CI/CD Testing:** A future home for experimenting with GitHub Actions workflows.
*   **General Experimentation:** A playground for any new tools or techniques without cluttering a real project.

This project follows best practices, including the use of a `LICENSE` and a `.gitignore` file, even in a testing environment.
